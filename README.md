MY USER STORY

AS AN Aspiring web developer and software engineer

I WANT to create a daily schedule planner that accounts for the current timestamp and displays what time slots are available or not for past, current, and future appointments

SO THAT I can showcase my javascript, bootstrap, moment and jquery fundamentals while also having a new schedule planner that I can use daily (and be proud of!)

SUPPLIED USER STORY

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
